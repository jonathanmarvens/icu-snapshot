 * This is a small interface I made to assist with converting from a formatter pipeline object to a
 * pattern string. It allows classes to "export" themselves to a property bag, which in turn can be
 * passed to {@link PatternString#propertiesToString(Properties)} to generate the pattern string.
 *
 * <p>Depending on the new API we expose, this process might not be necessary if we persist the
 * property bag in the current DecimalFormat shim.
